Project Summary
The envisioned Scholarship Management System is a centralized, cloud-based platform designed to streamline the entire scholarship lifecycle—from application submission through review, award distribution, and fund management. Its main purpose is to simplify and automate scholarship administration, making the process more efficient, transparent, and accessible for all parties involved. Target users include students applying for scholarships, scholarship administrators managing programs, reviewers evaluating applications, financial aid staff handling disbursements, and donors or other stakeholders monitoring the impact of their contributions.
